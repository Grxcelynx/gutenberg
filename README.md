# Gutenberg Block Patterns Referance 

## These files are ONLY for referance when setting up your custom block patterns

# Inside all-block-patterns folder:
* You MUST create a folder JUST LIKE the all-block-patterns folder that lives INSIDE the plugin folder.
* The plugin folder is inside of the wp-content folder of your Local Site
* Adjust elements to your site as needed
* REMEMBER: this is just a layout and syntax referance for you, NOT someting you want to just copy and paste into your files without changing anything

# Files to referance in the patterns folder
 * front-page.php - this file will have the function you need to put inside of your homepage/front-page php file to load in your patterns

# Other Notes:

* You can create a SCSS file inside of your regular SCSS folder in your theme's folder for your pattern's style. Just be sure to name it the same as the file inside your all-block-patterns folder.
* So if my php file is patterns.php then the SCSS file to register would be _patterns.scss
